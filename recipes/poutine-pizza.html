    <h2 class="small-header">Description</h2>
    <p>This recipe adds a great Canadian favorite, poutine - gravy, cheese, and fries - to the world's favorite, pizza.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 cup lukewarm water</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon instant yeast</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
        <li>1 (14 ounce) package frozen French fries (such as McCain®)</li>
        <li>cooking spray</li>
        <li>10 slices bacon, chopped</li>
        <li>1 (12 ounce) bag shredded Mexican cheese blend (such as Kraft®)</li>
        <li>½ cup pizza sauce, or as needed</li>
        <li>1 (10.5 ounce) can beef gravy, or as needed</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place flour in a large bowl. Whisk water, egg, yeast, and sugar together in a cup. Make a well in the flour and pour in yeast mixture. Stir until mixture forms a smooth dough, adding a small amount of flour or water if needed. Cover bowl with a towel; set aside to rise until doubled in size, about 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Spread French fries in a single layer on a baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Bake fries in the preheated oven until golden, about 20 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Heat a large skillet over medium heat and fry bacon pieces until browned, about 5 minutes; remove to drain on a paper towel.</li>
        <li>Spray a round pizza pan with baking spray.</li>
        <li>Punch down dough, and flatten onto pizza pan. For a stuffed crust, sprinkle about 1/4 cup shredded Mexican cheese blend around the edge of the dough, roll dough inward over cheese, and pinch dough to seal.</li>
        <li>Spread a thin layer of pizza sauce over dough. Spread fries over dough; pour gravy over fries as needed to cover. Top with remaining Mexican cheese blend. Sprinkle bacon pieces evenly over pizza.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is bubbly and crust is golden, about 20 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
